<p>As stipulated in data protection law, individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed;</li>
<li>When the individual withdraws consent;</li>
<li>When the individual objects to the processing and there is no other legal ground for the relevant processing activity;</li>
<li>When the personal data was unlawfully processed;</li>
<li>Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
